<p>Tony and Pete(the Adame brothers) and J-Bird their business partner, were Mexican boys in high school when a 65-year-old white man came to their school for career day. He told them how he started his own business. During that time they didn't care to listen about the valuable advice given to them. Little did they know they were going to start a business of their own one day. These 3 men created Suavecito, a famous Pomade product, with fan clubs in Amsterdam, Thailand, Japan, and in many more places. Pete was a machinest and his mentor inspired him to make something of his own, so he decided to make hair product made of Japan-based Cool Grease. He realized the material was too expensive so he grabbed 5-gallon Home Depot buckets and began experimenting. They gave the product to their friends but soon barbers were selling the product in baggies and tupperware containers to cutomers demanding the magical product. As that was going on, Pete got layed off and wanted to open a hot dog restaurant but didn't have the money to do so. They decided to sell enough of the product to make their dreams come true but after the initial 4,000 cans sold in an instant they knew they had to get serious. Suavecito began growing quickly and the next thing they know, Suavecito was more popular than the mexican products, Three Flowers and Moco de Gorilla. The company now travels around the world to meet with fans and attend car shows regularly. Their humbleness is admirable because they tech their workers to sell Suavecito at a cheap price to kids who can't afford it. To end a lesson we can learn form Ton, Pete and J-Bird is to never lose track of where you're from.</p>
