		<p> Camp Mariastella began at USC specifically the Lyon Recreation Center. When I got there I couldn't believe the amount of the new faces I was seeing. There were so many boys like me, of color, high school students, low income, and we all loved technology. I heard the instructors saying we have to learn everybody's name, so everyone looked around and asked, "what's your name?" I was surprised that everyone was so cooperative and made things a lot easier. The bus ride to camp with Kayvan lasted 2 hours. As soon as we got there we unloaded and ate burgers. After lunch, we unpacked and counted off at the ampitheatre, there were 56 of us. To continue, we went to the lodge and wrote our camp agreements, "We will help and ask for help", "We will respect eachother's space", etc. I was surprised on how many strategy games we played, for example , the human knot. We played the human knot the whole day to learn how to speak up and communicate with each other. I was worn out by the end of the day. Having done a bunch of push ups and a lot of walking.

		<p>Last night we slept at 11:20p.m. It was chilly outside but I brought a thick blanket, unlike my TXT Coach Mercelino who only had a shirt and a towel as a blamket. When I woke up I couldn't believe how dark it was outside. Everyone was saying it was "morning". After changing pants and t-shirt we walked up to the ampitheatre. Oscar talked to us about life and how life is a game. To be honest, I never looked at life in Oscar's prespective and admire his ideas. After some time we learned more from Oscar like how to be detail oriented and how to be original. Not to mention we got our phones taken away which made me feel uncomfortabele because I couldn't check the time or text my friends. The most interesting thing I learned today was to not get caught doing the wrong things at the wrong time. I don't come from a gang background or criminal background but I have had friends who are. Thank God I don't hang out with them anymore, not because they were bad people but because I was at risk being caught doing something stupid with them. </p>

		<p>Third day of camp. I've learned so much at camp I can't believe it. Luckily I have an Uncle who prepared me for times such as these. My Uncle Erick always teaches me how to be a gentlemen and how to do well in life like how to learn and take advice. He painted a picture in my head of how a sponge soaks up water. This ananlogy portrays me as the ponge and the water is the advice. He taught me to soak up advice like sponge and this was all I was thinking about while listening to advice from Oscar and Fredy an all the other coaches with us. On the other hand, I have learned how to fail and fail as a team. My team and I have done 150 pushups an amount I have never completed in my life. Finally, my TXT brothers and I have grown close together and have been learning together the whole way through camp. </p>

		<p>Final day of camp. Today we woke up at 5a.m and headed to the ampitheatre. There we reflected on the lava game, one of the hardest games I've ever played. My team took 2 days to complete the game but we finally did it. When the night came we played another game called the stick game. I have never played this game but it taught me how to think outside the box. I was the 5th to last one to figure the game out. I overthought the game when it was simple. I could apply the game to my life by paying attention to detail in my surroundings. I also learned about integrative thinking. Integrative thinking is used when you work with a group. When 2 people have different ideas and create tension over which one to choose, they use the best of their ideas to create a better one. Although we didn't go in the pool or play basketball I learned a lot and had some fun. We left camp at 1p.m and met with our families back at the Lyon Recreation Center. I was happy to see my family and told them all about what I learned. They were impressed and are proud of me. I'm sure I'll do well in TXT as long as I work hard.</p>

		<p>I forgot to mention but I've been sick since the 2nd day of camp. I think I got sick because I took a shower at night and must've caught a cold that way. My Mom always tells me to stay warm after I shower but I still got sick. It was pretty bad on the bus ride home. I felt lightheaded, my ears were hurting because of the chnage in elevation, I had a runny nose, and I was cold because of the A/C in the bus. So for, I've been relaxing on my day off(Monday). I stayed home and watched anime the whole day. I was pretty sick today so I couldn't go to the park and play basketball like I usually I do. In fact ever since school ended and TXT began, I haven't shot a single hoop. </p>

		<p>Today's Tuesday, another day off of TXT. Today was like yesterday except I served at church today. Every Tuesday my StepDad attends leadership class at our church, Cristo Para Las Naciones. I've been learning HTML lately using W3Schools. It's a great website that helps you learn coding using examples. I enjoy learning HTML although there's so many elements and attributes. My favorite part about coding is seeing the results of my work. For example lately I've been working on my website. At first I struggled learning how to make tabs for my website but after using one of W3's exapmles I got it. And oh man I felt like I achived the greatest thing in life when I saw my website complete and functioning.</p>

		<h3>6-20-17</h3>
		<p>Today's he last day before we go back to TXT. I've still been sick but I'm still going tomorrow. I've been learning more HTML and other languages. I feel new to this coding thing but I just need to put some time into it. I've made a lot of new friends and feel like I'm going to have a good summer. This program will edify me and teach me about life. I'm really curious about his demo day thing. It's going to be my first time participating and I'm nervous.</p>

		<p>Today is my second day of TXT ever since the day before camp. The first day I felt really lost and confused. But after going through camp with these guys I feel better. Suprisingly some kids dropped out the program and I am seeing new coaches. The new coaches introduced themselves today and honestly my favorite coach is Hau. Concepts like sharing ideas and speaking up were repeated today. Oscar taught us today how to work as a team and execute. He used examples from basketball which I wasn't familiar with. I also learned the 4 leadership roles; Project Manager, Production Manager, UX Designer, and the Developer. I never knew Oscar recieved an Undergraduate degree, Masters degree, and 4 years of PHD. Today was all about community and what a community was. I think it was because we will be put in groups and come up with a problem in our community or soemthing like that. So far I learned that communities can be complicated because some communities can be subcommunities. But anyway, I can say I'm part of the hispanic and undocumented community as well as the electronic specifically Apple loving community.</p>

		<p>Thursday, Arnold Avelos came to TXT to speak to us. He was from Mexico and is currently a millionaire. He gave us advice like to take the opportunties in front of you which was ironic because he was an opportunity to grow and become a millionaire like him, and was in front of us. I never knew you couldn't get a degree on sales but apperently there isn't. I already knew a little about stocks and the stock market from 8th grade when my teacher told us it was an immense opportunity to become rich. Arnold taught us more about stocks that as the company grows and the stocks raise in value the company will multiply your stocks because the value of one stock is so high. The last thing I'm going to mention is that Arnold taught us to not forget where we came from. My Auntie has a picture with this quote and now that Arnold talked about it I understood it. It means to honor those who helped you get to where you are and to give back to the community you came from.</p>

		<p>Leadership creed number 4 is, "I believe in helping my nieghbors and community". I think this means that when I am older I should give back to my community in ways like working in my community. If I work in my community as an architect I will improve the cities appearence. Another thing is that neigbors does not only mean the one's who live around you but the people who you see daily and live in your community. Like the person you see everyday at the bus stop. We can help by working to create a safe space for the people in our community. We can create organizations that will help the people in need make it through life. I believe helping those around you is important because we all need help in life. We are not perfect and don't have everything we need when we wake up. We have to reach out to people for help and assistance. Whether it's a coding error that you can't figure out or have to make a tough decision, we all need help.

		<p> Leadership creed number 9 is, "I believe in the habit of doing more than asked for". Throughout TXT I have been told to do more than asked for. Personally, in school I have learned that doing more than what is asked for is how you get high scores and in my school, a four. In school I usually don't do more than the assignment. For example, when I am given an assignment I finish it in class and turn it in and hope I did good in it. I can apply this creed at school because when I'm given an assignment I should strive to get the highest score the teacher offers and if not even more. If the teacher offers extra credit I will do it. This will result in an amazing grade. But I believe this creed is not just to do good in life and accomplish good things. I think it has to do more than honoring yourself and pushing yourself to do better. So in the long run, doing more than asked for improves yourself which connect to leadership creed number 8, "I wills trive to know myself better and seek slef improvement".
		I know following this creed will help me a ton and will apply it anywhere I go.

		<p>Leadership number 10 is ,"I will strive to strenghten my mind body and soul". Oscar always says life is not just about physical strength but about your ability to have a strong and hardworking mind so that we could be able to withstand any obstacle. So when I hear streghten the mind I think of learning more and improving my ability to go through any situation. Many think of working out and muscles when they hear "body" but I believe it means
